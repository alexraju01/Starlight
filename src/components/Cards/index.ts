// File in components/Cards
export { default as MediaCard } from './MediaCard';

// If these folders each have an index.tsx (recommended):
export { default as MediaCard2 } from './MediaCard2';
export { default as SearchCard } from './SearchCard/SearchCard';

// If they don't have index files yet, point to the file inside:
// export { default as MediaCard2 } from './MediaCard2/MediaCard2';
// export { default as SearchCard } from './SearchCard/SearchCard';
